            <h1>Well, Hello!</h1>
            <p>I am Elena, and I am glad to see you’ve scrolled to this point.
                I am happy to introduce myself to you. 
                I’m originally from Russia and have lived in the US for the last 17 years. 
                
                All these years in the US I have spent a great deal of time observing the American people in hopes to adopt the culture and lifestyle. Through various experiences I have learned many things about the US, as well as about myself. I’ve realized that I’m drawn to many different things like art, languages, good food and interior and digital design. I draw so much inspiration from people and things around me. 
                
                Working as a compliance officer for the last 15 years has brought me in contact with many fascinating people around the world. I have connected with them and learned from them by observing what they do and how they work. The desire to observe and analyze has brought me to UX. I look forward to share my own experiences and findings here.</p>
